# Lehrerkalender-Privacy Policy

Welcome to your Lehrerkalender app for Android!

This is a free Android app developed by Joshua Coordes. The app is available on Google Play.

I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences and all data) created by  you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data cache or by uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will do my best to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Joshua Coordes
